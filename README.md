StateManagement

This is a sample project for my Flutter students. It shows three different state management techniques.

1. BLOC using (FLUTTER BLOC)
2. Cubit
3. Riverpod + StateNotifier

There are four main steps in Riverpod. Notice how easy it is to inject providers into each other. (ApiManager was injected into ClimateNotifier)
